# CCVanillaUI

This is a small add-on that focuses on replacing the default [CosmeticsCore][cc] GUIs and icons with more vanilla-like ones.

It currently changes the following assets:

- Wardrobe GUI
  - This also includes the buttons for hat, body and balloon cosmetic types
- Customization GUI
- Cursor Icons

## How to install

You can download the zip file from the [latest available download][releases].  
It will contain a folder called `z_cosmetics`.

Extract this folder and put it into the same location where you extracted the assets when you first installed CosmeticsCore on your server.  
You will be asked if you want to override existing files. Confirm this action.

Finally, update your resource pack and re-apply it to all people (How you do this depends on how the resource pack is created and managed).
